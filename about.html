            <h2>What we are about</h2>
            <p>Xecution Designs, is a small company wanting to grow into something bigger. We develop small indie style games and are looking to expand into making websites and applications - all just for fun.</p>
            <p>Xecution Designs started its journey with making small games (that were never published to the public) with the Unity game engine. This all started when I (the head of Xecution Designs) came across a youtube video of a youtuber called Brackeys. Brackeys is a youtuber who makes tutorials on how to make games with the Unity game engine. I was inspired by his videos and decided to give it a go. I started making small games and learning how to code in C#.</p>

            <p>The video shown below is the first video I watched, and that was the video that made me change what my favourite hobby was.</p>
